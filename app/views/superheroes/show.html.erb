<!-- On the superheroes index page, a superhero's name should link to the superhero's show page.

The superhero show page should include the superhero's name (eg. Peter Parker), its super name (eg. Spider-Man), and its superpower. The superpower should link to the superpower show page.

The superpower show page should have its name and description.

Add a filter to the index view of the superheroes. This will allow the visitor to search for an existing superpower and display all the superheroes with that superpower on the same view page. -->
